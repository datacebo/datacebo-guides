description: "How to use the HMASynthesizer in SDV Community effectively"
---

When you begin working with SDV Community, the primary tool for modeling multi-table datasets is the HMASynthesizer. _HMA_ stands for Hierarchical Modeling Algorithm, a synthesizer originally designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. It works by learning a separate model for each grouping within a multi-table structure, allowing it to capture relationships and dependencies across tables.

In this guide, we will walk through:

- The limitations of the HMASynthesizer and what they mean in practice
- How to effectively leverage the HMASynthesizer despite these limitations
- Resources for exploring alternative approaches that overcome the HMASynthesizer’s constraints
