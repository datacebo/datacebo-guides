You maybe building a platform or part of team that is creating a synthetic data module in a larger data platform. Here are the insights we have gathered from our users who use SDV Community and integrate with their platform. 

### You are essentially creating a startup within a large enterprise. 

First and foremost, recognize that you are effectively building a startup within a large enterprise. You are introducing a deep AI technology and working to scale its adoption across the organization. As a result, all the challenges that come with launching and growing a new technology apply.

Success requires more than just building the platform and its tooling. You must also invest in internal marketing, sales, and advocacy to drive awareness, build trust, and encourage adoption alongside the technical work.

### Selecting the right partner for synthetic data generation is critical. 

Your provider must be able to meet many of the same requirements typically associated with enterprise data environments. While it may seem acceptable to defer these requirements and revisit the decision later, doing so can significantly limit adoption and overall success.

Early on, only a small group of users will be willing to act as early adopters. Within that already limited group, external factors—unrelated to the product itself or users’ intentions—can easily shift priorities and reduce participation. This makes that initial cohort especially valuable.

Losing any of these early adopters is costly. When all other conditions are aligned, the last reason you want users to disengage is because the synthetic data generation software cannot handle the complexity of their data. Choosing a partner that can support enterprise-level complexity from the outset is essential to sustaining momentum and driving long-term adoption
