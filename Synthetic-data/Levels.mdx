Synthetic data for relational and tabular datasets has come a long way. Technically the definition of synthetic data is data generated using algorithms. These algorithms can be written by developers, or automatically created by machine learning, or generative AI tools specifically large language models (LLMs for short).  However, there are multiple types of synthetic data and each type can support different level of use. In this guide we will define:

- Types of synthetic data. Types are organized by the expected quality and use of the data produced and the properties it has.
- Levels of synthetic data generation.  Levels of generation organizes different ways of generating synthetic data based on the manual effort required to get synthetic data that can be used for different applications. 

## Types of synthetic data 

| Type | Defining property                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | No information content synthetic data                   |
| 2    | Heuristically corrected synthetic data                  |
| 3    | Information rich synthetic data                         |
| 4    | Information rich conformative synthetic data            |
| 5    | Infinitely information rich conformative synthetic data |

**Type 1: No information content synthetic data**. Data has no information as it is completely randomly created. In many cases, most data is uniformly distributed, no correlations are present. 

**Type 2: Heuristically corrected synthetic data.** Data here is step up from Type 1 with some patterns (information content) introduced by patching some of the data generated in Type 1, either manually or using a tool. For example, changing the distribution of gender column to 70% male and 30% female. 

**Type 3: Information rich synthetic data.** Data here follows all the statistical distributions and has the correlations that your real data may have. It does not require any correction as it is able to capture those properties. However, some post processing is required to adjust the formats, and making it conform to your data structures - relational structure, referential integrity and other important constraints. 

**Type 4: Information rich conformative synthetic data.** Data here has all the statistical properties and also conforms to your original structure - whether there it is the relational structure or constraints. Data here is ready to use without any post processing. It emulates your real data completely and can be directly embedded into downstream applications. 

**Type 5: Infinitely information rich conformative synthetic data.** Data here has richness beyond what you see in your real data. It contains diverse data in the neighborhood of your original data. For example, if your original data only has customers between age of 19-36 buying a product A, and you have customers between the age of 26-36 who bought both product A and product B, it has data that has synthetic customers buying product B between the ages of 19-26.

  At Type 4 where the data is information rich and is conformative to your original structures you are able to use the data directly for your downstream applications. Lack of ability to produce synthetic data at this level is a biggest blocker for synthetic data adoption and reduces the scale at which you can use synthetic data - for one experimental project vs. at an enterprise level.

## Levels of synthetic data generation 

Before we categorize different synthetic data generation methods, let us go through different methods of generating synthetic data and the workflows that they entail. For each method, we will provide what type of synthetic data it produces based on our type classification above and also describe methods and techniques used to bring them to type 4 at which point the synthetic data becomes usable synthetic data.
