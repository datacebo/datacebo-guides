Synthetic data for relational datasets has come a long way. Technically the definition of synthetic data is data generated using algorithms. These algorithms can be written by developers, or automatically created by machine learning, or generative AI tools specifically large language models (LLMs for short).  However, there are multiple types of synthetic data and each type can support different level of use. In this guide we will define:

- Types of synthetic data. Types are organized by the expected quality and use of the data produced and the properties it has. 
- Levels of synthetic data generation.  Levels of generation organizes the types from lowest quality to highest quality. At each level, we have provide a reference guide to describe the tooling used, the role of humans, generative modeling (via machine learning) and generative AI, and the type of data generated. 

Type 1: No information content synthetic data 

Type 2: Rule-patched synthetic data

Heuristically corrected synthetic data
