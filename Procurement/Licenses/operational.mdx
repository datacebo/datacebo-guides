Operational license allows you to operationalize our software in a variety of ways across several projects. In this article, we will provide several examples and also highlight how this becomes a step towards getting a full enterprise license.

### Overview

If you have done one or more of the following, operations license is the next logical step for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Used SDV Community">
    You may have used SDV Community and successfully implemented projects. SDV Community is good for single table and for some use cases. SDV community can only supporting 3-5 tables with 1 level of depth. You may have also acquired an exploratory license.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acquired a project based license ">
    You may have acquired a project based, and with our support, you have successfully executed your project and achieved results. You are now planning to expand to multiple projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **What do we mean by operational use**

Operational use usually means that you are using SDV Software across more projects and most of your projects require repetitive modeling and sampling, SDV artifacts (models or data) are shared with multiple users, you may want multiple users to be able access SDV software, build models and experiment with it. 

<Note>
  Most of what you can do is also possible through project based license, except in project based license, you can only use the software to model and sample one project as defined by the metdata.
</Note>

Finally you could try to enhance your SaaS software using DataCebo (or SDV) software; which is not possible in a project based license. 

### Examples

An enterprise team has an offshore team that writes data ETL pipelines for a data model. These ETL pipelines produce the necessary output for dashboards and various reports. The data is in microsoft SQL. The offshore team does not have access to the volumne and variety of data that they have in production to test their ETL pipelines. As a result, when the offshore team sends the ETL scripts or SQL queries, the onshore team usually runs in bugs or performance issues. They raise tickets and the offshore team reworks the scripts. This back and forth is time consuming and usually results in delays in generating reports and simply lack of productivity. As their first project, they picked one database , build a model and created 100 million+ synthetic data points used to created synthetic data for a mysql database. They share this data with their offshore team. Offshore team now uses this data to test and debuge their ETL pipelines and queries. It reduced the back and forth by 20% (as measured by the number of JIRA tickets). Now the enterprise team wants to expand this to another database over which analytical or ETL pipelines are being written. Or given the results from the first project, they may want to do this for several databases. 

Enhancing your SaaS offering: \*\*Integrating the DataCebo Software into a Software as a Service application to enhance your offering, as long as it is hosted in your environment and the Software as a Service does not compete with the DataCebo Software.

**What you cannot do**: Any other use of the DataCebo Software for commercial purposes is expressly prohibited under this license.
