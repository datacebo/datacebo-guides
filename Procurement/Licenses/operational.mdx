Operational license allows you to operationalize our software in a variety of ways across several projects. In this article, we will provide several examples and also highlight how this becomes a step towards getting a full enterprise license.

### Overview

If you have done one or more of the following, operations license is the next logical step for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Used SDV Community">
    You may have used SDV Community and successfully implemented projects. SDV Community is good for single table and for some use cases. SDV community can only supporting 3-5 tables with 1 level of depth. You may have also acquired an exploratory license.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acquired a project based license ">
    You may have acquired a project based, and with our support, you have successfully executed your project and achieved results. You are now planning to expand to multiple projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **What do we mean by operational use**

Operational use usually means that you are using SDV Software across more projects and most of your projects require repetitive modeling and sampling, SDV artifacts (models or data) are shared with multiple users, you may want multiple users to be able access SDV software, build models and experiment with it. 

<Note>
  Most of what you can do is also possible through project based license, except in project based license, you can only use the software to model and sample one project as defined by the metdata.
</Note>

Finally you could try to enhance your SaaS software using DataCebo (or SDV) software; which is not possible in a project based license. 

### Examples of expanding from one project to multiple projects 

**Reducing ETL Rework Through Production-Scale Synthetic Data.** An enterprise team relies on an offshore group to build SQL-based ETL pipelines that feed dashboards and reports. Because the offshore team does not have access to production-scale data—with its full volume and variety—their ETL scripts often fail or perform poorly when tested onshore. This leads to repeated bug reports, rework, and delays.

To solve this, the enterprise team created a synthetic dataset of over 100 million records for one database and shared it with the offshore team. With realistic test data, the offshore team was able to debug and tune their pipelines upfront, reducing JIRA tickets by 20%.

  Given this success, the enterprise team now wants to expand synthetic data generation to additional databases to improve productivity across multiple offshore teams.

**Operationalizing Synthetic Data for Scalable Performance Testing Across Modules.** An insurance-focused ISV supports many clients using a shared product built on a universal data model with 1,000+ tables. Because each client uses different modules and the vendor releases updates frequently, performance issues often appear when clients load their own large datasets after a new release. The ISV cannot replicate client-level data volume in their test environments, making it hard to detect throughput problems before deployment.

To evaluate whether synthetic data can help, the team selected one client using a specific module that touches 50 tables. They built an SDV model using a small sample dataset, generated high-volume synthetic data, and tested the next software release with this realistic load. After optimizing the software based on these tests, the release met performance expectations.

  Following this success, the ISV now wants to generate synthetic data for multiple clients for the same module, and eventually for multiple modules. Each module-and-client combination becomes its own project, so the team aims to operationalize SDV to support many projects efficiently.

Enhancing your SaaS offering: \*\*Integrating the DataCebo Software into a Software as a Service application to enhance your offering, as long as it is hosted in your environment and the Software as a Service does not compete with the DataCebo Software.

**What you cannot do**: Any other use of the DataCebo Software for commercial purposes is expressly prohibited under this license. 

1. **Enabling a third party to use the DataCebo Software is prohibited**. These include the following scenarios (but not limited to): 
   1. Integrating the DataCebo Software in a Software as a Service application is prohibited.
   2. Integrating the DataCebo Software into a solution that is deployed in a third party environment is prohibited.
   3. Copying, distributing, disclosing or sharing with any third party the models generated using the DataCebo Software, or enabling a third party to model or sample data using the software, is prohibited. 
   4. Using the DataCebo Software to generate or sample a model in a third party environment is prohibited.
