Operational license allows you to operationalize our software in a variety of ways across several projects. In this article, we will provide several examples and also highlight how this becomes a step towards getting a full enterprise license.

### Overview

If you have done one or more of the following, operations license is the next logical step for you. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Used SDV Community">
    You may have used SDV Community and successfully implemented projects. SDV Community is good for single table and for some use cases. SDV community can only supporting 3-5 tables with 1 level of depth. You may have also acquired an exploratory license. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Acquired a project based license ">
    You may have acquired a project based, and with our support, you have successfully executed your project and achieved results. You are now planning to expand to multiple projects. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **What do we mean by operational use**

Operational use usually means that you are using SDV Software across more projects and most of your projects require repetitive modeling and sampling, SDV artifacts (models or data) are shared with multiple users, you may want multiple users to be able access SDV software, build models and experiment with it. Finally you could try to enhance your SaaS software using DataCebo (or SDV) software. 

<Note>
  Most of what you can do is also possible through project based license, except in project based license, you can only use the software to model and sample one project as defined by the metdata. 
</Note>

### Examples 

1. **Automated or Repetitive Data Modeling or Sampling: **Using the DataCebo Software for automated or repetitive data modeling or sampling. Incorporating the software into automated scripts or systems that execute tasks on a recurring schedule.
2. **Ensure Operation, Reliability, Enhancement, or Availability of An Application, Service or System: **Using the DataCebo Software to ensure operation, reliability, enhancement, and or availability of an application, service, or system to its end-users and/or other dependent systems. _E.g.: for software testing purposes, to train a simulation model used by an application, to sample a model and populate a database that is used for analytics._
3. **Multi-User Access: **Granting multiple users access to the DataCebo Software or deploying it in a multi-tenant environment. _E.g.: training a model and allowing a different user to sample from the model_.
4. **Enhancing your SaaS offering: **Integrating the DataCebo Software into a Software as a Service application to enhance your offering, as long as it is hosted in your environment and the Software as a Service does not compete with the DataCebo Software.

**What you cannot do**: Any other use of the DataCebo Software for commercial purposes is expressly prohibited under this license. 

1. **Enabling a third party to use the DataCebo Software is prohibited**. These include the following scenarios (but not limited to): 
   1. Integrating the DataCebo Software in a Software as a Service application is prohibited.
   2. Integrating the DataCebo Software into a solution that is deployed in a third party environment is prohibited.
   3. Copying, distributing, disclosing or sharing with any third party the models generated using the DataCebo Software, or enabling a third party to model or sample data using the software, is prohibited. 
   4. Using the DataCebo Software to generate or sample a model in a third party environment is prohibited.
