Once you have succeeded with many projects perhaps in one use case, we find customers wanting to deploy the product for multiple use cases and across multiple projects within those use cases. This usually can span multiple departments. At this level, the scaling goes beyond just one team. 

<Note>
  Read an entire report about how ING Belgium scaled across multiple use cases, multiple departments and their journey. Our licensing structure is grounded in the knowledge we gained with deployments that have scaled in this way.

## Multiple axes in this license 

In this licens we provide strategic consulting in addition to the full platform functionaltiy. 

## Base platform price

A base platform fee is applied depending on the bundles you choose to add. The base platform, without any bundles, includes the ability to model an unlimited number of tables and sample from it and support 10 different data types.

## Adding SDV Enterprise Bundles.

Bundles are priced as add-ons to the SDV Enterprise (Basic) license. As discussed earlier, different customers require different add-ons at different stages of their adoption journey.  For details on available bundles, check out this page.

## Scaling across applications

The pricing model of SDV Enterprise is application-centric, meaning that pricing scales with the number of applications a customer supports with SDV. We designed it this way because applications represent the value customers get from the product — the more applications they use synthetic data for, the more business impact they achieve. As customers move through the adoption journey, they naturally expand their use of SDV across more applications and use cases.

An application in this context refers to a use case where synthetic data is applied; for example, an ML model, a software application, or a data pipeline that relies on synthetic data for testing, data augmentation, or analytics. Each application is represented by a collection of tables that must be synthesized together to support a use case. To account for these applications, we have created pricing buckets that allow customers to scale their usage incrementally. 

The table below gives an overview of the pricing model.

| **Number of Applications** | **SDV Enterprise (Base)**       | \*\*SDV Enterprise Bundles \*\* | Total                                       |

| Between 20 and 100         | _Base Price + Applications Fee_ | _Add On(s)_                     | _Base Price + Applications Fee + Add On(s)_ |
| Between 100 and 500        | _Base Price + Applications Fee_ | _Add On(s)_                     | _Base Price + Applications Fee + Add On(s)_ |
