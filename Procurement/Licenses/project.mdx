A **project-based license** allows you to use our software for a single, well-defined project and supports you through achieving a successful implementation. Many teams start by building an end-to-end workflow with SDV Community and then look to scale their model to cover a larger set of tables.

On this page, we provide an overview of how a project-based license works, the key advantages it offers, and examples of successful implementations we’ve seen.

## How it works?

A project involves building, maintaining, and deploying a generative model using Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) Enterprise for a single data asset. The goal is to enable ongoing synthetic data generation for analytics, development, testing, or privacy-preserving or data sharing workflows.

_Steps to get a project specific SDV Enterprise package. _

### Get started 

The project centers on a single data asset—a collection of interconnected relational tables (e.g., a database schema). The data model is defined using SDV Metadata, which describes the tables, primary and foreign key relationships, and column data types (sdtypes).

To get started, you can either use SDV Community or request a license key for our AI connectors, which can connect directly to your database, extract the metadata, and register it with DataCebo. After that, you’ll receive a license key to install the SDV Enterprise package for your project in your environment.

### Training the SDV generative model 

With SDV Enterprise package and the metadata, you can follow the standard steps to train a model. You may retrain the generative model repeatedly for new batches of real data, or when you update certain parameters of the metadata and if you would like to improve the quality of the model. Each retraining operation uses the same SDV metadata (unless an allowed metadata update is applied—see Section 4).

### Repetitive Sampling from the Trained Model

Once the model is trained, you can sample synthetic data any number of times, with no fixed upper limit. You can sample at scheduled interval, or on demand or programattically within the downstream pipelines. The synthetic data retains the statistical properties and relationships learned from the original tables, according to the SDV metadata.

### Deployment flexibility 

<Note>
  Technical caveat on this: Right now, a trained SDV model (pkl file) can only be loaded and sampled in an environment with the same Python version. \
  \
  For example,  if you trained and saved the synthesizer in an environment with Python 3.11, you cannot later load & sample from it in a different environment with Python 3.10. (Even though SDV Enterprise supports Python 3.10 and Python 3.11)
</Note>

The trained SDV model can be deployed to any environment where SDV Enterprise is supported, including; on-premises infrastructure or cloud platforms, VPCs or workstations. 

Deployment includes the ability to load the trained model, perform on demand sampling and integrating sampling into existing applications or data pipelines. 

### Allowed Metadata Updates

During the life of the project, a **predefined, fixed number of metadata updates** are permitted. The allowed updates are restricted to:

1. Updating column “sdtypes”. Example: changing a column from numerical to categorical, or updating datetime formats.
2. Updating table connections. Example: redefining foreign key relationships or restructuring how tables link together.

These updates enable controlled evolution of the data model while ensuring stable modeling and sampling across retraining cycles.

## Key advantages of project based license

- **Low cost:** Only  per year for a single project.
- **Full implementation:** You can use it to deliver an end-to-end project, giving you a complete, hands-on experience with the SDV Enterprise product.
- **Flexible commitment:** There’s no fixed POC end date requiring an upfront decision on a larger investment. You can expand to additional projects as your needs grow.
- **Enterprise support:** You gain access to our enterprise support channel for direct assistance and faster response times.
- **Simplified Legal Process**: Additionally, because our project-based license agreement includes confidentiality provisions, there is no need for a separate MNDA.
