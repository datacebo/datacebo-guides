title: "Project based license"
---

A project based license enables you to use our software for one well scoped project and achieving a successful implementation. You may have already developed an end to end implementation with SDV Community and are looking to expand and develop models for larger databases. In this page we will give an overview of how it works, what are the key advantages of project based license and a few examples of successful implementations we have seen.

## How it works?

This project involves building, maintaining, and deploying a generative model using Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) Enterprise for a single data asset. The goal is to enable ongoing synthetic data generation for analytics, development, testing, or privacy-preserving workflows.

### Scope: Single Data Asset Modeling

- The project focuses on one data asset, consisting of a collection of interconnected relational tables (e.g., a database schema).
- The data model is defined via SDV Metadata, which specifies:
  - Tables
  - Primary and foreign key relationships
  - Column data types (sdtypes)
- You may retrain the generative model repeatedly, for example:
  - When new batches of real data arrive
  - When metadata parameters are updated
  - When the model needs quality improvements

Each retraining operation uses the same SDV metadata (unless an allowed metadata update is applied—see Section 4).

### Repetitive Sampling from the Trained Model

- Once the model is trained, you can sample synthetic data any number of times, with no fixed upper limit.
- Sampling can occur:
  - At scheduled intervals
  - On demand
  - Programmatically within downstream pipelines
- The synthetic data retains the statistical properties and relationships learned from the original tables, according to the SDV metadata.

  ### Deployment flexibility 

  <Note>
    Technical caveat on this: Right now, a trained SDV model (pkl file) can only be loaded and sampled in an environment with the same Python version. \
    \
    For example,  if you trained and saved the synthesizer in an environment with Python 3.11, you cannot later load & sample from it in a different environment with Python 3.10. (Even though SDV Enterprise supports Python 3.10 and Python 3.11)
  </Note>
- The trained SDV model can be deployed to any environment where SDV Enterprise is supported, including:
  - On-premises infrastructure
  - Cloud platforms
  - Isolated environments (e.g., VPCs)
  - Developer workstations
- Deployment includes the ability to:
  - Load the trained model
  - Perform on-demand sampling
  - Integrate sampling into existing applications or data pipelines

### Allowed Metadata Updates

During the life of the project, a **predefined, fixed number of metadata updates** are permitted. The allowed updates are restricted to:

1. Updating column “sdtypes”
   - Example: changing a column from numerical to categorical, or updating datetime formats.
2. Updating table connections
   - Example: redefining foreign key relationships or restructuring how tables link together.

These updates enable controlled evolution of the data model while ensuring stable modeling and sampling across retraining cycles.

## Key advantages of project based license

- **Low cost:** Only  per year for a single project.
- **Full implementation:** You can use it to deliver an end-to-end project, giving you a complete, hands-on experience with the SDV Enterprise product.
- **Flexible commitment:** There’s no fixed POC end date requiring an upfront decision on a larger investment. You can expand to additional projects as your needs grow.
- **Enterprise support:** You gain access to our enterprise support channel for direct assistance and faster response times.
- **Simplified Legal Process**: Additionally, because our project-based license agreement includes confidentiality provisions, there is no need for a separate MNDA.
