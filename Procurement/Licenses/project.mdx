A **project-based license** allows you to use our software for a single, well-defined project and supports you through achieving a successful implementation. Many teams start by building an end-to-end workflow with SDV Community and then look to scale their model to cover a larger set of tables.

On this page, we provide an overview of how a project-based license works, the key advantages it offers, and examples of successful implementations we’ve seen.

## How it works?

A project involves building, maintaining, and deploying a generative model using Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) Enterprise for a single data asset. The goal is to enable ongoing synthetic data generation for analytics, development, testing, or privacy-preserving or data sharing workflows.

### Scope: Single Data Asset Modeling

The project focuses on one data asset, consisting of a collection of interconnected relational tables (e.g., a database schema). The data model is defined via SDV Metadata, which specifies:

- 
  - Tables
  - Primary and foreign key relationships
  - Column data types (sdtypes)
- You may retrain the generative model repeatedly, for example:
  - When new batches of real data arrive
  - When metadata parameters are updated
  - When the model needs quality improvements

Each retraining operation uses the same SDV metadata (unless an allowed metadata update is applied—see Section 4).

### Repetitive Sampling from the Trained Model

1. Once the model is trained, you can sample synthetic data any number of times, with no fixed upper limit.
2. Sampling can occur:
   - At scheduled intervals
   - On demand
   - Programmatically within downstream pipelines

The synthetic data retains the statistical properties and relationships learned from the original tables, according to the SDV metadata.

### Deployment flexibility 

<Note>
  Technical caveat on this: Right now, a trained SDV model (pkl file) can only be loaded and sampled in an environment with the same Python version. \
  \
  For example,  if you trained and saved the synthesizer in an environment with Python 3.11, you cannot later load & sample from it in a different environment with Python 3.10. (Even though SDV Enterprise supports Python 3.10 and Python 3.11)
</Note>

The trained SDV model can be deployed to any environment where SDV Enterprise is supported, including; on-premises infrastructure or cloud platforms, VPCs or workstations. 

Deployment includes the ability to load the trained model, perform on demand sampling and integrating sampling into existing applications or data pipelines. 

### Allowed Metadata Updates

During the life of the project, a **predefined, fixed number of metadata updates** are permitted. The allowed updates are restricted to:

1. Updating column “sdtypes”
   - Example: changing a column from numerical to categorical, or updating datetime formats.
2. Updating table connections
   - Example: redefining foreign key relationships or restructuring how tables link together.

These updates enable controlled evolution of the data model while ensuring stable modeling and sampling across retraining cycles.

## Key advantages of project based license

- **Low cost:** Only  per year for a single project.
- **Full implementation:** You can use it to deliver an end-to-end project, giving you a complete, hands-on experience with the SDV Enterprise product.
- **Flexible commitment:** There’s no fixed POC end date requiring an upfront decision on a larger investment. You can expand to additional projects as your needs grow.
- **Enterprise support:** You gain access to our enterprise support channel for direct assistance and faster response times.
- **Simplified Legal Process**: Additionally, because our project-based license agreement includes confidentiality provisions, there is no need for a separate MNDA.
