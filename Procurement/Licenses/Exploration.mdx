Many users start successfully with SDV Community but encounter a limitation: it can only model **3–5 tables with a single level of depth**. For many enterprise use cases, this is restrictive. While numerous products exist in the market, none can generate models for an **unlimited number of tables**. Time and again, we’ve heard from customers that this limitation is a barrier to scaling synthetic data across their broader datasets.

> _We have hundreds of tables that need to be modeled together, and the generated data must maintain referential integrityand inter-table patterns. We cannot provide massive amounts of data to build the model, and we don’t want a solution that requires a full compute cluster to run._

**From SDV Community to SDV Enterprise: Modeling Hundreds of Tables**. From day one, our core philosophy at DataCebo has been to build a product that can handle this challenge. While SDV Community and many other tools don’t support it, customers understandably want to know whether it’s even possible to build a generative model for a large, multi-table dataset and sample from it before investing significant time.\_. \_

To address this, we provide a exploration license at a very minimal price. With this license customers can verify that SDV can

- Model a database that has more than 50 tables and sample from such a model
- Does not require a large compute cluster to be able to do this.
- Can build a model with limited amount of data.

We’ve realized that customer confidence in feasibility is essential before they commit to a project-based or operational license.

<Info>
  Algorithmically, our HSASynthesizer can model any number of tables at any depth. In practice, our deployments have handled up to 200 tables. It’s also worth noting that as the number of tables grows, many are often reference tables that may not require modeling at all.

### What is packaged in an exploration license?

This license provides a base SDV Enterprise package with the following additional features (on top of SDV Community) and corresponding functionality that they can test.

| Feature Type       | Feature         | Functionality you can test and validate on top of SDV Community                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synthesizer        | HSASynthesizer  | Ability to model 100's of tables and sample from them.                                                                                                |
| Synthesizer        | DayZSynthesizer | Ability to generate data with just metadata for 100's tables                                                                                          |
| Data type modeling | GPS             | Ability to model and sample GPS coordinates that match the statistical distribution and their correlation with other variables as seen in other data. |
| Data type modeling | Phone numbers   | Ability to model and sample Phone numbers that match the statistical distribution and their correlation with other variables as seen in other data.   |
| Data type modeling | Addresses       | Ability to model and sample Addresses that match the statistical distribution and their correlation with other variables as seen in other data.       |

### Limitations

**Time Limitation:** The package is valid for three months. Once you’ve confirmed that the approach works, you can transition to a project-based license - which is a cost effective license with which you can deploy our product for one project.

**Bundles:** This package does not include the additional bundles available with SDV Enterprise, such as Constraint-Augmented Generation, XSynthesizers, and various AI accelerator bundles.
