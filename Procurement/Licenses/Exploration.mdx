Several users succeed with SDV Community and then hit a stumbling block - SDV Community can only model upto 3-5 tables and with only level of depth. Many enterprise use cases find this limiting. However, many products in the market are not able to address the challenge of being able to build a generative model for unlimited number of tables. Time and again we have heard from cusomters - 

> we have 100's of tables that need to modeled together, and data generated should have referential integrity and the inter table patterns. 

Our core philosophy from day one was to be able build a product that handles this challenge. So while many don't provide this capability, and we do not either in our SDV Community, customers are rightfully wanting to assess whether it is even possible before investing too much time in this direction which is :_build a generative model for a large set of multi table and sample from it. _ 

To address this, we provide a exploration license at a very minimal price. With this license customers can verify that SDV can 

- Model a database that has more than 50 tables and sample from such a model
- Does not require a large compute cluster to be able to do this. 

This confidence is necessary to
