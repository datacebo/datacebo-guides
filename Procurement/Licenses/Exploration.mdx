Many users start successfully with SDV Community but encounter a limitation: it can only model **3–5 tables with a single level of depth**. For many enterprise use cases, this is restrictive. While numerous products exist in the market, none can generate models for an **unlimited number of tables**. Time and again, we’ve heard from customers that this limitation is a barrier to scaling synthetic data across their broader datasets.

> _We have hundreds of tables that need to be modeled together, and the generated data must maintain referential integrityand inter-table patterns. We cannot provide massive amounts of data to build the model, and we don’t want a solution that requires a full compute cluster to run._

**From SDV Community to SDV Enterprise: Modeling Hundreds of Tables**. From day one, our core philosophy at DataCebo has been to build a product that can handle this challenge. While SDV Community and many other tools don’t support it, customers understandably want to know whether it’s even possible to build a generative model for a large, multi-table dataset and sample from it before investing significant time._. _

To address this, we provide a exploration license at a very minimal price. With this license customers can verify that SDV can 

- Model a database that has more than 50 tables and sample from such a model
- Does not require a large compute cluster to be able to do this. 
- Can build a model with limited amount of data. 

We’ve realized that **customer confidence in feasibility is essential** before they commit to a project-based or operational license.

<Info>
  While algorithmically our HSASynthesizer can model any number of tables in a database with any depth, so far in our deployments we have seen upto 200 tables. It is also important to note that as the number of tables grow large, it is very likely that many are reference tables that may not need modeling at all.
