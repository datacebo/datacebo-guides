Many users start successfully with SDV Community but encounter a limitation: it can only model **3–5 tables with a single level of depth**. For many enterprise use cases, this is restrictive. While numerous products exist in the market, none can generate models for an **unlimited number of tables**. Time and again, we’ve heard from customers that this limitation is a barrier to scaling synthetic data across their broader datasets.

> We have **hundreds of tables** that need to be modeled together, and the generated data must maintain **referential integrity**and **inter-table patterns**. We cannot provide massive amounts of data to build the model, and we don’t want a solution that requires a full compute cluster to run.

Our core philosophy from day one was to be able build a product that handles this challenge. So while many don't provide this capability, and we do not either in our SDV Community, customers are rightfully wanting to assess whether it is even possible before investing too much time in this direction which is :_build a generative model for a large set of multi table and sample from it. _ 

To address this, we provide a exploration license at a very minimal price. With this license customers can verify that SDV can 

- Model a database that has more than 50 tables and sample from such a model
- Does not require a large compute cluster to be able to do this. 

This confidence is necessary to move forward with a project based license or an operational license.
