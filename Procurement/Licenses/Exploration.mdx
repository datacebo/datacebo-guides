Many users start successfully with SDV Community but encounter a limitation: it can only model **3–5 tables with a single level of depth**. For many enterprise use cases, this is restrictive. While numerous products exist in the market, none can generate models for an **unlimited number of tables**. Time and again, we’ve heard from customers that this limitation is a barrier to scaling synthetic data across their broader datasets.

> _We have hundreds of tables that need to be modeled together, and the generated data must maintain referential integrityand inter-table patterns. We cannot provide massive amounts of data to build the model, and we don’t want a solution that requires a full compute cluster to run._

**From SDV Community to SDV Enterprise: Modeling Hundreds of Tables**. From day one, our core philosophy at DataCebo has been to build a product that can handle this challenge. While SDV Community and many other tools don’t support it, customers understandably want to know whether it’s even possible to build a generative model for a large, multi-table dataset and sample from it before investing significant time._. _

To address this, we provide a exploration license at a very minimal price. With this license customers can verify that SDV can 

- Model a database that has more than 50 tables and sample from such a model
- Does not require a large compute cluster to be able to do this. 
- Can build a model with limited amount of data. 

This confidence is necessary to move forward with a project based license or an operational license.
