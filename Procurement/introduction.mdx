## Welcome

We offer multiple ways to license our software, designed to support a “crawl, walk, run” adoption approach for enterprises. We strongly recommend beginning with a project-based license to ensure success on a single, well-scoped initiative before expanding to multiple projects and ultimately moving to an enterprise-wide custom license.

## **Key concepts**

| Project (or application)    | A Project (or application) is an environment where SDV is embedded so that the model and synthetic data generation can be regularly updated.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data asset**              | A data asset is a set of interconnected tables that are modeled and synthesized together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Bundles**                 | Bundles are collections of related functionality that are packaged together to address a specific use-case requirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Synthetic data accelerators | Synthetic data accelerators are designed to address even more complexity within enterprise datasets, provide integrations and enable you develop models at scale.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| AI accerlators              | **AI Accelerators** are bundles designed to help you build AI models and accelerate AI adoption. They leverage SDV to generate synthetic data, but the creation of SDV models and synthetic data is fully abstracted. This allows you to focus on achieving your end goals without dealing with the underlying data generation processes. |

## Licensing SDV Community

SDV Community is distributed under a Business Source License (BSL), which places limitations on how it may be used. Please review the guidance on this page for more information.

SDV Community can be licensed directly from us for a range of use cases, usually via an OEM agreement. Below we outline two scenarios. If either applies to your use of SDV Community, we’d love to hear from you—please get in touch to explore partnering through an OEM agreement.

**Using SDV Community to improve your product**.

You are integrating SDV into your own end product, where SDV runs within your product to generate synthetic data that enhances functionality or service quality. This is considered **embedded use**, meaning your end users do not access, interact with, or use SDV directly. Instead, SDV operates solely as an internal component to improve the results and experience delivered to your end users.

<Info>
  **Example:** You offer an HR product that trains an employee attrition model nightly, updates predictions, and generates recommendations. To train this model, your product generates synthetic data using SDV Community. This constitutes an **embedded use** of SDV Community, as SDV Community runs within your product and is not accessed or used directly by end users.
</Info>

**Bundling SDV Community with your own product and services.** 

You are bundling SDV Community with your own product and services, and your end users use SDV Community **directly**. This means end users access and interact with SDV Community functionality, including—but not limited to—metadata detection, synthesizer training, sampling, data transformation, and any other capabilities provided by SDV Community.

<Info>
  **Example:** You offer a data privacy product that supports data governance, role-based access control, and data lineage. You incorporate SDV Community into your offering to allow end users to create synthetic data. End users can connect the product to their data, use SDV Community to create and train an SDV model, store the model, and generate synthetic data.

  This is a direct, user-facing use of SDV Community, as end users access and interact with SDV Community functionality directly.

## Licensing SDV Enterprise

SDV Enterprise offers a wide range of additional functionality, enabling you to build models for larger databases. It also includes bundles designed to help you scale synthetic data generation across diverse use cases and projects within your enterprise. We provide several licensing options that support a **“crawl, walk, run”** approach, allowing you to start small and scale your synthetic data initiatives over time.
