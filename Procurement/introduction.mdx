## Welcome

We offer multiple ways to license our software, designed to support a “crawl, walk, run” adoption approach for enterprises. We strongly recommend beginning with a project-based license to ensure success on a single, well-scoped initiative before expanding to multiple projects and ultimately moving to an enterprise-wide custom license.

## **Key concepts**

A Project (or application) is an environment where SDV is embedded so that the model and synthetic data generation can be regularly updated.

A data asset is a set of interconnected tables that are modeled and synthesized together.

Bundles are collections of related functionality that are packaged together to address a specific use-case requirement.
