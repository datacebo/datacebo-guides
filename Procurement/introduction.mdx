## Welcome

We offer multiple ways to license our software, designed to support a “crawl, walk, run” adoption approach for enterprises. We strongly recommend beginning with a project-based license to ensure success on a single, well-scoped initiative before expanding to multiple projects and ultimately moving to an enterprise-wide custom license.
